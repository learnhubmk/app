1. **File Naming**: Test files should have the same name as the component they are testing, suffixed with `.test.ts`.

2. **Test Structure**: Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern. Set up the component, perform actions, and assert expected outcomes.

3. **Assertions**: Use Jest's built-in assertions and matchers along with React Testing Library utilities for querying elements.

4. **Isolation**: Ensure tests are isolated and do not depend on the state of other tests.

5. **Mocking**: Utilize Jest's mocking capabilities to isolate component behavior and dependencies.
